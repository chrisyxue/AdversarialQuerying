# Adversarially Robust Few-Shot Learning:  A Meta-Learning Approach

### Micah Goldblum, Liam Fowl, Tom Goldstein

This repository contains PyTorch code for adversarial querying with [ProtoNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175), [R2-D2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08136), and [MetaOptNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03758.pdf).  Adversarial querying is an algorithm for producing robust meta-learners.  More can be found in our [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00982).  We adapt models and data loading from [here](https://github.com/kjunelee/MetaOptNet).
